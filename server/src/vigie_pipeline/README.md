# vigie-pipeline (P1 core) ops notes

```sh
export VIGIE_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/vigie
uv run python -m vigie_pipeline run --once          # one pass, exit 1 on unreadable shard/schema
uv run python -m vigie_pipeline run --loop 30       # repeat every 30 s; failures are logged and retried
# first start on an empty data dir: --migrate lets the pipeline apply ingest's migrations
```

Settings (flag / env): `--transient-window-s` / `VIGIE_TRANSIENT_WINDOW_S` (24 h),
`--min-dwell-s` / `VIGIE_TRANSIENT_MIN_DWELL_S` (2 h), `--promotion-cap` /
`VIGIE_PROMOTION_CAP_PER_HOUR` (20). `0` for the window is an error.

## Trust model
- A hostname never promotes a device. A transient device is promoted only after it was received
  in >= 2 distinct server hours (`batches.received_at`) and its first-to-last-seen dwell is >= the
  minimum, at most `promotion cap` per server hour (extra devices stay transient and one
  `promotion_rate_limited` event is emitted per hour). Unpromoted transients are retired after the
  window; a retired device seen again returns to transient (`device_reappeared`).
- `dhcp_fingerprint` / `vendor_class` are first-wins. A differing value for the same MAC is not
  stored; the device is set to `identity_state='conflict'` and one `identity_conflict` event per
  (device, field) per day is emitted (short hashes only). Hostnames may change freely.

## overrides.db and file permissions
The pipeline opens `overrides.db` with `mode=ro` plus `PRAGMA query_only=ON` and never writes
data pages. `overrides.db` is expected to be in WAL mode (written by `vigie-api`). Reading a WAL
database may still create or touch the `-wal` / `-shm` sidecar files, so the pipeline and the API
**must run as the same uid/group** (or the data directory must otherwise allow the pipeline to
create the sidecars); a pipeline that cannot create `-shm` cannot read a WAL database.

## Known gaps
- 90-day pruning/aggregation of retired transient MAC rows (PRP section 8 housekeeping) is NOT
  implemented; see the strict-xfail test `test_retired_transient_mac_rows_are_pruned_after_90_days`.
  `observations` and `transient_*` rows grow until it lands.
- Ingest owns `devices`/`observations`/`collectors`/`batches`; the pipeline verifies their schema
  version and refuses to run (or to downgrade) unless `--migrate` is given.
